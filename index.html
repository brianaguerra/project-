     <h1 > What Is Gentrification</h1>
          <p> The process whereby the character of a poor urban area is changed by wealthier people moving in, improving housing, and attracting new businesses, typically displacing current inhabitants in the process.  </p>

            <h1> Who Is Being Affected</h1>
         <p> Residents in these neighborhoods being gentrified are getting affected and are losing their homes and culture. They're loosing a part of their childhood, life, and themselves. </p>
      
            <h1> Why Is Gentrification Important </h1>
            It is taking out the culture and true people from these cities. People who grew up and lived their whole life in that part of city, people who have generations of family in that part of the city, people who there whole lives are based around that part of the city, and it is all being taken away in a short amount of time. Many people have to move farther from a place they call home. Homelessness rates have grown a lot more since gentrification has started happening. It's breaking families apart, and ruining lives.
